## 📖 About the Project
As my first 'serious' project while learning JavaScript, I wanted it to have all the existing and futuristic features a discord bot could have, 
a one stop solution for your server so that you dont have to risk giving permissions to 20 different bots for some 'unique' features they hold. 
it was being constantly updated for 2 years [2019-2021] until I got really busy in real life and decided to deprecate the project.. until maybe 2026. 
It was built on discord.js version 12.5.1 and was deprecated with the release of discord.js version 13 in August 2021. It has Pagination, Button interface, Slash Commands[BETA], and much more!
Feel free to fork and PR.
